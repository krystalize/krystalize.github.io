					<h2>Software Design and Development</h2>
					<p>From SQA:
						Candidates develop knowledge, understanding and practical problem-solving skills in
						software design and development, through a range of practical and investigative tasks using
						appropriate software development environments. This develops their programming and
						computational-thinking skills by implementing practical solutions and explaining how these
						programs work. Tasks involve some complex features (in both familiar and new contexts),
						that require some interpretation by candidates. They are expected to analyse problems, and
						design, implement, test and evaluate their solutions.
					</p>
					<p>Language focus: Python</p>

					<h2>Website Design and Development</h2>
					<p>From SQA: Candidates develop knowledge, understanding and practical problem-solving skills in web
						design and development, through a range of practical and investigative tasks. This allows
						candidates to apply computational-thinking skills to analyse, design, implement, test and
						evaluate practical solutions to web-based problems, using a range of development tools such
						as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Tasks involve some complex features (in both familiar and
						new contexts), that require some interpretation by candidates.
					</p>
					<p>Language focus: HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>

					<h2>Database Design and Development</h2>
					<p>From SQA: Candidates develop knowledge, understanding and practical problem-solving skills in
						database design and development, through a range of practical and investigative tasks. This
						allows candidates to apply computational-thinking skills to analyse, design, implement, test,
						and evaluate practical solutions, using a range of development tools such as SQL. Tasks
						involve some complex features (in both familiar and new contexts), that require some
						interpretation by candidates.
					</p>
					<p>Language focus: SQL</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="CS" class="tabcontent">
					<h2>Computer Structure</h2>
					<p>From SQA: Candidates develop an understanding of how data and instructions are stored in binary form
						and basic computer architecture. They gain an awareness of the environmental impact of the
						energy use of computing systems and security precautions that can be taken to protect
						computer systems.
